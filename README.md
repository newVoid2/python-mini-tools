# Python-Mini-Tools

A collection of small, focused Python scripts I build every day while going through my learning-path.  
Each tool does one thing, cleanly — no fluff, just functionality.

---

## What you’ll find inside

- Simple, standalone tools (each in the `tools/` folder)  
- Code that practices core Python features: input/output, loops, functions, data types  
- My transition toward backend / data-engineering work  
- Nothing too heavy — just daily tools I build, refine, and commit  

---

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newVoid2/python-mini-tools.git

2. Navigate into tools/ and explore a script.
   cd python-mini-tools/tools
   python password_masker.py

3. Run a tool and see what it does — feel free to edit it, refactor it, or build your own!

## Why it matters

These little tools help me build muscle in Python every day.
By the time I reach bigger projects, I’ll have practiced the foundation many times.

## What’s next

+ More tools every few days
+ Clean up existing tools (refactor, add tests, improve docs)
+ Build the first “serious” project (Python + data oriented) and move it from practice → portfolio
