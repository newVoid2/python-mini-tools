# Python-Mini-Tools

A growing collection of small, practical Python tools I’m building as I work through my learning path.
Each script focuses on one idea or concept — clean, simple, and easy to extend later.

The goal is not complexity, but consistent practice and writing code the “professional” way:
clear structure, docstrings, type hints, and examples.

## Tools

### Password Masker
A lightweight utility that asks for a username and password, then prints a masked version of the password.
Good practice for working with user input, string manipulation, and clean output formatting.

### Find Duplicates
A tool that checks a list for duplicate items and returns only the unique duplicates.
Reinforces list iteration, conditional logic, and writing small, reusable functions.

## Purpose of This Repo

This repo is my space to:
- Practice writing small Python tools
- Build clean, readable scripts
- Use docstrings, type hints, and simple structured functions
- Improve one tool at a time before moving to bigger projects

Nothing here is meant to be “production-level” — it’s all about steady improvement.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newVoid2/python-mini-tools.git

2. Navigate into tools/ and explore a script.
   ```bash
   cd python-mini-tools/tools
   python password_masker.py

4. Run a tool and see what it does — feel free to edit it, refactor it, or build your own!

## Coming Soon

More small utilities as I continue through Python, data structures, and backend concepts.
